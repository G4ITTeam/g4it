CLIMATE_CHANGE;Climate change;Greenhouse gases (GHG) are gaseous components which absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface 1 and thus contribute to the greenhouse effect.;kg CO2 eq
PARTICULATE_MATTER;Particulate matter and respiratory inorganics;The presence of small-diameter fine particles in the air - especially those with a diameter of less than 10 microns - represents a human health problem, since their inhalation can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems.;Disease incidence
IONISING_RADIATION;Ionising radiation;Corresponds to the effects of radioactivity. This impact corresponds to the radioactive waste resulting from the production of nuclear electricity.;kBq U-235 eq
ACIDIFICATION;Acidification;"Air acidification is linked to emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ammonia and hydrochloric acid. These pollutants turn into acids in the presence of moisture, and their fallout can damage ecosystems as well as buildings. ";mol H+ eq
RESOURCE_USE;Resource use (minerals and metals);Industrial exploitation leads to a decrease in available resources whose reserves are limited. This indicator assesses the amount of mineral and metallic resources extracted from nature as if they were antimony.;kg Sb eq
