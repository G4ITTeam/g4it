But beware: by seeking to reduce the impact of one criterion, you run the risk of transferring the impact to another criterion or another phase of the life cycle (<a href='https://www.eco-conception.fr/static/leco-conception-les-concepts.html' target='_blank'>eco-design principles</a>). One way of avoiding this pitfall is to demonstrate sobriety at all levels of your service. <br> <h3>​ A scale suited to multi-criteria analysis: the people equivalent. </h3>​ All graphs are expressed in 'people Eq': to understand this unit, imagine defining a fixed amount for each resident of the planet, corresponding to the planetary limits that must not be exceeded individually to guarantee the overall balance of the system.
