## Description

The use case allows a sustainable IT leader to visualize the application's impact of the Information system, which is
versioned to track their evolution over time.

By browsing an organization's application portfolio, you can quickly identify the application infrastructures with the
greatest environmental impact.
This empowered development teams, focuses on eco-design efforts, and identifies inconsistencies between infrastructure
sizing and actual application requirements.

More information about how indicators are produced here:
https://gitlab-forge.din.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/pub/numeco/m4g/numecoeval/-/blob/develop/docs/MoteurDeCalculG4IT_V1.1.adoc

**Navigation Path**

Input :
- My Information System / Visualize my inventories / My inventory / Application button

Output :
- My Information System / Visualize my inventories / My inventory / Application footprint page

**Access Conditions**  
The connected user must have the read role for that module one the selected organization.
