## Description

This use case allows a sustainable IT leader to generate and download the previously uploaded files, used to create
datacenters, physical and virtual equipment or applications, as well as their evaluated impacts, in .csv format.

**Restrictions :**  
This is only for users with "write" role access.  
Export files generated during export are kept for 7 days on Azure storage space and deleted afterward.  
When this allowed time expires, an error message appears when user tries to download.
