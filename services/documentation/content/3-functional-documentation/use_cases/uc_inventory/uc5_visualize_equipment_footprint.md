## Description
The use case allows a sustainable IT leader to visualize the inventory's impact of the Information system, which is versioned to track their evolution over time.
The key indicators displayed on the radar graph are data center and equipment.
The results can be filtered by a number of criteria, such as the country of the equipment/data center.
It is also possible to display results for a single criteria only.

More information about how indicators are produced here:
https://gitlab-forge.din.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/pub/numeco/m4g/numecoeval/-/blob/develop/docs/MoteurDeCalculG4IT_V1.1.adoc

1. Radar graph representing the equipment's impact by criteria in people eq.
2. By overflowing, the user can collect data corresponding to a certain phase in the life cycle of the equipment, a click on a specific criteria redirects to view by criteria
3. Each tab represents the impact for one specific criterion
4. Filter's menu. On this view, filters available are :
    * Country
    * Entity
    * Equipment
    * Status
5. Each button allows seeing the impact for one specific filter
6. Quick description of what people eq. means
7. Key indicators about a Data center
8. Key indicators about Equipment

**Navigation Path**

Input :
- My Information System / Visualize my inventories / My inventory / Equipment button 

Output :
- My Information System / Visualize my inventories / My inventory / Equipment footprint page

**Access Conditions**  
The connected user must have the read role for that module one the selected organization.
