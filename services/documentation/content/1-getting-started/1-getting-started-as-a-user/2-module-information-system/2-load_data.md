    4. **Server Characteristics**:
        - Adjust these for a more accurate footprint evaluation based on your knowledge.
        - For example, annual operating time affects the impact of usage.
    5. Complete the server creation or move to the next step.

![Screenshot showing the form to select server reference, datacenter selection, and input for server characteristics.](../media/10_add_server_step_2.png "Screenshot showing the form to select server reference, datacenter selection, and input for server characteristics.")

##### **Step 11:** Create a New Datacenter

- **Action:** Add the characteristics of the datacenter:
    1. **Name**
    2. **Location**: This information will help determine which electricity mix to use when evaluating the impact of usage.
    3. **PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)**: A measure of energy efficiency in the datacenter. Lower PUE indicates better efficiency, as it compares the energy used by infrastructure versus cooling and power distribution.

![Screenshot showing the form for adding a new datacenter, with fields for name, location, and PUE value.](../media/11_add_server_add_datacenter.png "Screenshot showing the form for adding a new datacenter, with fields for name, location, and PUE value.")

##### **Step 12:** Create a Virtual Machine (VM)

    - **Name**
    - **Quantity**
    - **Size**: The resource allocation for each virtual machine (e.g., CPU cores, storage).
    - **Operating Time**: The total uptime of virtual machines throughout the year, measured in hours.
2. **Action:** Edit or delete the VM as needed.
3. **Action:** Finalize the creation of the server and associated virtual machine.

- **Action**: Click the "Add Cloud Service" button to start adding your cloud infrastructure.

![Screenshot showing the "Add Cloud Service" button to create a new cloud instance.](../media/13_add_cloud_instance.png "Screenshot showing the 'Add Cloud Service' button to create a new cloud instance.")

##### **Step 14:** Complete Cloud Services Information

1. **Action:** Configure the parameters for the cloud services:
    - **Name**
    - **Provider**: e.g., AWS, Azure
    - **Type of Instance**: Based on the available instances for AWS and Azure.
2. **Action:** Describe how the service is used:
    - **Quantity**
    - **Location**: This information will help determine which electricity mix to use when evaluating the impact of usage.
    - **Operating Time**: The total uptime of cloud services throughout the year, measured in hours.
    - **Average Workload**: As a percentage of CPU usage.
3. **Action:** Click **Add** to save your input.

This current page just show you sample files with minimal data permit you to make a first assessment.
In the datamodel file (cf. picture below to find it) you will explore all the rules necessary to integrate files that permit to estimate environmental impact of an inventory.
![datamodel file](../images/DataModel_Loading.png)

### Datacenter

> NOTE : name of each datacenter must be unique

A Datacenter file is needed for all physical equipment (mainly servers) located in data centres. It permit for now to take into account the efficiency of this datacenter that is measure with PUE indicator. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is a ratio that describes how much energy is used by the computing equipment in contrast to cooling and other overhead that supports the equipment.

#### Sample template
| Templates                                                                    | Comment                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Example with mandatory field](../documents/datacenter_sampleMandatory1.csv) | the separator for PUE is a "."<br/>the country must exist in the plateform |

### Physical Equipment
A Physical Equipement file is the most important file in G4IT. It often come from an extract of a  CMDB (Configuration management database).  
you can play with the quantity for a mutualized equipement (example : a TV share with several teams half time, you can put 0,5 in the quantity to take intro account only the part dedicated to your perimeter)

> NOTE : name of each physical equipement must be unique

- **Equipement tpye** : must be in the list of authorize type (a default equipment for each type will be use if )

#### Physical equipment pre-filled template
| Template                                                   | Input                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [Laptop](../documents/User_Devices_01_Laptop_Template.csv) | Serial number; Model; Purchase date; Laptop usage country |

### Virtual Equipment
> NOTE 1:  
Virtual Equipement is larger than Virtual Machine. it represent all it is needed for an application (include a dedicated server. In that last case see here)
When you know the hosted technical architecture. 

> NOTE 2 : Name of each physical equipement must be unique

#### host characteristics under control
#### Cloud Services (host characteristics not under control)
