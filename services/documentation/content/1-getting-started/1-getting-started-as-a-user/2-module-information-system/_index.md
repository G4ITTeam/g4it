An inventory i.e. a sum of physical and virtual equipement necessary for the operation of an activity (at scale of an information system, a team, an appliactive portofolio...)

## Introduction to Assessing the Environmental Impact of an inventory

To integrate IT sufficiency into team activities you don't need any impact evaluation : Sufficiency is just a mindset  to adopt by design in evry activities.
It means mainly reduce the number of equipment use by a team, extend their lifespan (take care of them and repair them if necessary) and pay attention to their electricity consumption.
An environmental impact assessment only permit to identify key contributors to that impact, prioritise action and manage a continuous improvement over the time, to create the conditions for sufficiency to become a reality.

## global approach 
What are the main step to adopt a sufficiency approach base on environmental impact assessment ?

1. **Identify the perimeter**:
Is not mandatory to address the entire perimeter from the outset. A progressive approach is a good way to familiarise with the global approach.
You can wonder what kind of equipment and services is necessary to carry out an activity enlarging in a systemic view: 
	- **For a Public or private organization** : it is all IT equipement (Laptop, mobile phones, IoT, printer..) and IT services (Virtual Machine, Cloud services, Network, User devices...)  necessary to deliver its value.
	- **For a Team** it is all IT users device (Laptop, Monitor, TV in meeting rooms...)
	- **For a collaborators of an applicative portofolio** : it is all servers (physical and virtual) permit to application to run, it means all environnement (production, integration, developement...), so this can also include suppliers, customers, partners, etc.
	
2. **Evaluate the Impact**: 
   - If the inventory is already in use, base the evaluation on real data.
   - You can also simulate an inventory using assumptions
   
3. **Identify Major Impact Areas**: Identify the component of the inventory that contribute the most to its environmental impact. 

4. **Analyze Current Practices**: Assess the practices currently apply in the perimeter. 

5. **Propose an Action Plan**:
    Based on the best practices, create an action plan to reduce the environmental impact of your inventory. 

6. **Manager Over the time**:
    It is crucial to follow over the time the impact to verify if actions plan are working well. This helps to keep teams motivated and to take measures to address the issues at stake.

## Using G4IT for the Assessment

With G4IT you evaluate the impact of an inventory for a fix duration of 1 year.
