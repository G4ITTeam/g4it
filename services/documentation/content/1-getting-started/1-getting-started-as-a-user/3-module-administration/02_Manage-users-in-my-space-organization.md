## Objective
This guide explains how to add or manage members of an organization on G4IT.

## Prerequisites
- The user to be added must have logged in to G4IT for the first time.  
  Refer to the [First Login](./01_First-Login).
- You must be an administrator of your organization.

## Step 1: Access the Administration Area
In G4IT, locate the menu on the left side with a key icon: this represents the administration area.

## Step 2: Search for Users
In the administration panel:
- Select your organization.
- Enter the email address or name of the person to add in the "Search for a referenced user" field.
- If the person does not yet have access, click on the add icon (represented by a plus sign) in the "Actions" column.

## Step 3: Assign Permissions
A side panel will open:
- Choose the appropriate access level: "Read" or "Write."
    - **Read**: The user can view data but cannot modify it.
    - **Write**: The user can edit and modify data.
- Confirm the addition by clicking the confirmation button.
