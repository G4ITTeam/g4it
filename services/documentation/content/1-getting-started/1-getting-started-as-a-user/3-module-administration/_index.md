## Head to the Administration module!

You have access to this module if you are an administrator of at least one organization (creator or granted rights).

In this area, you can:

- **Manage users**: add members, assign/modify/delete their rights (read, write, administration).
- **Configure your organization**: define specific parameters, such as the environmental criteria used to calculate
  impact.
