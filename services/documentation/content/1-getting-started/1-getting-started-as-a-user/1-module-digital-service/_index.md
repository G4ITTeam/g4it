## Introduction to Assessing the Environmental Impact of a Digital Service

Assessing the environmental impact of a digital service helps identify the key contributors to that impact and set goals
to reduce it.

To integrate eco-design into the development of your digital service, follow these steps:

## Steps to Eco-Design a Digital Service

1. **Evaluate the Impact**:
    - If the application is already in use, base the evaluation on real data.
    - If the application is still in development or planned for the future, use assumptions about future users to
      estimate the impact.

2. **Identify Major Impact Areas**:  
   Identify the elements of the digital service that contribute the most to its environmental impact. This may include
   infrastructure, energy consumption, etc.

3. **Analyze Current Practices**:  
   Use a reference framework (such as RGESN, GR491, etc.) to assess the practices currently implemented in the digital
   service.

4. **Propose an Action Plan**:  
   Based on the best practices, create an action plan to reduce the environmental impact of your digital service.

5. **Start a Continuous Improvement Process**:  
   The evaluation is just the beginning. It is essential to monitor the impact regularly and adjust actions to
   continuously improve environmental performance.
