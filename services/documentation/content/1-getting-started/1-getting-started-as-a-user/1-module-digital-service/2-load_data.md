### **Data Exchange**

#### **Step 6:** Add a Network

- **Action**: Click the "Add Network" button to create a new network.

![Screenshot showing the "Add Network" button to create a new network entry.](../media/06_add_network.png "Screenshot showing the 'Add Network' button to create a new network entry.")

#### **Step 7:** Complete Network Information

- **Action**: Fill in the necessary details about the terminal network:
    1. **Network Type and Location**
    2. **Annual Data Exchange Volume**
    3. Click **Add Network** to save.

### **Servers**

#### If You Know the Details About Your Infrastructure Configuration

##### **Step 8:** Create a Server

- **Action**: Click the "Add Server" button to begin adding your server.

![Screenshot showing the "Add Server" button for creating a new server entry.](../media/08_create_server.png "Screenshot showing the 'Add Server' button for creating a new server entry.")

##### **Step 9:** Choose the Type of Server

- **Action**: Select the type of server you want to create:
    1. **Name**: Assign a unique name to your server.
    2. **Server Type**: Choose between **Dedicated** (a physical server dedicated to your service) or **Shared** (a server shared with other services, managed via virtual machines that you’ll configure later).
    3. **Server Purpose**: Choose **Compute** (for processing power) or **Storage** (for storing data).

![Screenshot showing the options for selecting server type and server purpose, with a form for entering server details.](../media/09_add_server_step_1.png "Screenshot showing the options for selecting server type and server purpose, with a form for entering server details.")

##### **Step 10:** Complete Server Information

- **Action:**
    1. **Select the Reference of the Physical Server**: You can use one of the first three options for rough sizing (S = Small, M = Medium, L = Large).
    2. **Datacenter Selection**: Select a datacenter from the list.
    3. **Create a New Datacenter**: Use the "Add Datacenter" button if necessary.
    4. **Server Characteristics**:
        - Adjust these for a more accurate footprint evaluation based on your knowledge.
        - For example, annual operating time affects the impact of usage.
    5. Complete the server creation or move to the next step.

![Screenshot showing the form to select server reference, datacenter selection, and input for server characteristics.](../media/10_add_server_step_2.png "Screenshot showing the form to select server reference, datacenter selection, and input for server characteristics.")

##### **Step 11:** Create a New Datacenter

- **Action:** Add the characteristics of the datacenter:
    1. **Name**
    2. **Location**: This information will help determine which electricity mix to use when evaluating the impact of usage.
    3. **PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)**: A measure of energy efficiency in the datacenter. Lower PUE indicates better efficiency, as it compares the energy used by infrastructure versus cooling and power distribution.

##### **Step 12:** Create a Virtual Machine (VM)

1. **Action:** Add the characteristics of the VM:
    - **Name**
    - **Quantity**
    - **Size**: The resource allocation for each virtual machine (e.g., CPU cores, storage).
    - **Operating Time**: The total uptime of virtual machines throughout the year, measured in hours.
2. **Action:** Edit or delete the VM as needed.
3. **Action:** Finalize the creation of the server and associated virtual machine.

#### **Cloud Hosting (IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service)**

##### **Step 13:** Create a Cloud Service

- **Action**: Click the "Add Cloud Service" button to start adding your cloud infrastructure.

![Screenshot showing the "Add Cloud Service" button to create a new cloud instance.](../media/13_add_cloud_instance.png "Screenshot showing the 'Add Cloud Service' button to create a new cloud instance.")

##### **Step 14:** Complete Cloud Services Information

1. **Action:** Configure the parameters for the cloud services:
    - **Name**
    - **Provider**: e.g., AWS, Azure
    - **Type of Instance**: Based on the available instances for AWS and Azure.
2. **Action:** Describe how the service is used:
    - **Quantity**
    - **Location**: This information will help determine which electricity mix to use when evaluating the impact of usage.
    - **Operating Time**: The total uptime of cloud services throughout the year, measured in hours.
    - **Average Workload**: As a percentage of CPU usage.
3. **Action:** Click **Add** to save your input.

![Screenshot showing the form to configure a cloud service, with fields for provider, instance type, location, and operating time.](../media/14_create_cloud_instance.png "Screenshot showing the form to configure a cloud service, with fields for provider, instance type, location, and operating time.")
