## Procedure

Some architecture diagrams are created using draw.io and are stored in the `3-technical-documentation/2-software_architecture` and `3-technical-documentation/3-technical_architecture` folders.

The diagrams are stored in the `drawio` format and are exported to `png` format in the images folder.

In order to modify the diagrams, you need to install the draw.io desktop application and open the `*.drawio` file.

Modify the diagram, store it in the `drawio` format and export it to `png` format.

Then, you can replace the existing `png` file in the `images` folder.
