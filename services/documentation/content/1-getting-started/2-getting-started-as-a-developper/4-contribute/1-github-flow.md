This page describe the github flows for Development and Release management.

The releated page [Git Commands]({{% ref 2-git-commands %}}) describes the commands.

## Development

Standard feature github flow (feat/n or fix/n) where n is the number of Jira task for developpement team or description of the contribution if it's open source contribution.

The feature branch must always be created from the main branch.

the feature branche could look like : feat/822, fix/823, feat/ext_contrib_description

{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch feat/n
    checkout feat/n
    commit id: "squash commits"
    checkout main
    merge feat/n
    commit
{{< /mermaid >}}

If the feature is too big, children branches can be created from feat/n, called feat/n_m

Example:
One US is called G4IT_BLM_100 and has 1 sub-task G4IT_BLM_101

{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch feat/100
    checkout feat/100
    branch feat/100_101
    checkout feat/100_101
    commit id: "squash child"
    checkout feat/100
    merge feat/100_101
    commit id: "squash US"
    checkout main
    merge feat/100
    commit
{{< /mermaid >}}

## Releases

Creation of a Git Tag (from Github UI), named for example 2.2.0.

Example of 2 releases (=2 tags):

{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch "tag 2.2.0"
    commit
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch "tag 2.3.0"
    commit
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
{{</mermaid>}}

The release x.x.x is then deployed as docker image on any target environment and does not change between environments.

## Hotfixes

In case of critial of blocking issue in __production__, a new hotfixed version can be created.

Imagine, the production environment has the __2.2.0__ version.

{{<mermaid>}}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit id: "tag commit"
    branch "hotfix/2.2.0"
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch "tag 2.2.1"
    commit id: "create tag"
{{</mermaid>}}
