In this section, you will get to know some color rules to respect while developing websites.

#### Information by color

Information provided only by the color impacts many users. It could be ignored by people who cannot
see or distinguish colors. For example, if an active page is only marked by a different color than
the other pages, it could be challenging for a user who cannot distinguish colors to perceive it.
That's why it is this important that any color that provides information must be accessible by another
way like a textual element.

#### Color contrast

If a text color is not sufficiently contrasted with his background color, it could be challenging or
impossible for a user to read it.
To evaluate the contrast of an element, you can use this pretty useful tool:
[WebAIM Contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
It will give you the contrast ratio for a foreground and background color combination.
