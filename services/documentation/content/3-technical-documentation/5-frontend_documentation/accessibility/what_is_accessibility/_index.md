In this section, you will learn what the accessibility is with definitions, examples and notable numbers

#### Definition

To begin, we first need to understand what accessibility is and why it is this important.
Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable for the widest range of people possible, and it also
includes those with disabilities.
It is indeed estimated that around 20% of the population has some sort of disability.
It's easy for us, designers and developers, to assume that everyone uses the web in the same way we do but that's simply
not the case.

#### Example of disabilities

Some people are partially or fully blind, some others have colorblindness :

- 1 in 12 men is affected
- 1 in 200 women as well
- it means around 5% of the population

Others use screen readers or navigate the web using only a keyboard.
Some have cognitive issues that affect learning, memory or perception.
Some have temporary issues like a broken arm or hand.

Outside of these more permanent situations, there are those who may experience technical issues like
a slow internet connection, small or large screen sizes and older technology.

To sum up, disabilities are very diverse and may be physical, mental, developed as we age or temporary.

#### What can we do about it?

It's our job to consider all these scenarios and make it as easy as possible for the wide range of people to access the
websites that we build.
Technology is for everyone, and we should design and build the web with this in mind. Not after its development but
before and during it.
And in most cases, even people without disabilities will benefit from websites that are accessible as well. To help
developers, a guideline has
been created: the [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). It
contains every important criteria about the web accessibility and sets the
standard for web accessibility legislation in most countries around the world. The French equivalent is
the [RGAA (Référentiel général d'amélioration
de l'accessibilité)](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/)
