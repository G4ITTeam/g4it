In this section, you will get to know some basis about links.

#### Links

A link must be explicit by itself (with an accessible name) or through its context.
It is necessary that the link text and/or the link context make it possible for the user to understand
its function and destination.

- By itself: The accessible name is the name of an interface element returned to assistive technology.
  It is determined by the content of ```aria-labelledby```, ```aria-label```, ```title``` or ```<a>```.

- Using a context: it makes sure that the context allows the user to understand the meaning. It could be defined in the
  content of the sentence enclosing the link, for example.
