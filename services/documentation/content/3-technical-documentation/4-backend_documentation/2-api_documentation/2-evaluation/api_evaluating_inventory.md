## Description

This api allows the user to evaluate inventory after loading. the user sends an inventoryId as pair as an organisation and subscriber.
This api is an asychronous api, the user will receive a response with a task id, and the status icon displays the progress percentage of the task by repeatedly calling the api GET /subscribers/{subscriber}/organizations/{organization}/inventories until the task is completed or failed.

## API Call Processing

{{< mermaid align="center">}}

flowchart LR
A[API Call for Evaluation] --> B(Get the active criteria to evaluate impacts on)
B --> C(Create the evaluating task with status TO_START)
C --> D(Launch asynchroneous evaluating process)
D --> E(Return the task id)
{{</ mermaid >}}

Note that, the loading process is done asynchronous.
Attention, to consume small resource the loading process is done by one thread. So if there are two evaluate
in the instance, one will wait for the other to finish.

The API call is handled
by [EvaluatingController](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/controller/EvaluatingController.java)
and the business logic is handled
by [EvaluatingService](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/EvaluatingService.java).
The method evaluating of EvaluatingService retrieves active criteria for evaluation or defaults to predefined criteria if none are active and then handles the logic for initiating and managing evaluation tasks.

## Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous evaluation process follows these steps:

{{< mermaid align="center">}}

flowchart LR
A[Set the Task in IN_PROGRESS] -->B[Create a local export directory specific to each task for storing csv files]
B --> C(Invoke the doEvaluate method of EvaluateService to perform evaluations)
C --> D[Set Task as COMPLETED upon successful execution with progress set to 100%]
D --> E[Save the indicators in the database tables]
E --> F[Compress results into a ZIP file and uploads it to file storage]
F --> G[Clean up local directory after successful execution.]

{{</ mermaid >}}

This process is done in
the [AsyncEvaluatingService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/AsyncEvaluatingService.java).

## Evaluation Process

The inventory data is evaluated using active criteria in the [EvaluateService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/EvaluateService.java).
Note: active criteria here refers to the criteria set for the an inventory to calculate the impacts for.

### Impact Calculation

The EvaluateService evaluates the physical equipments, virtual equipments and the applications associated with the inventory.
Following this evaluation, it aggregates the results using active criteria and lifecycle steps.

#### Cloud Virtual Equipment:

Virtual equipment entities are retrieved from the database in batches via the [InVirtualEquipmentRepository](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apiinout/repository/InVirtualEquipmentRepository.java).
Processes virtual equipment associated with cloud services based on infrastructure type.

The external service [BoaviztapiService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/engine/boaviztapi/EvaluateBoaviztapiService.java) method 'evaluate' is used for cloud-based evaluations.
The results for virtual equipment indicators are aggregated in memory, and both the input data and generated indicators are written to CSV files.

#### Physical Equipment:

Physical equipment entities are retrieved from the database in batches via the [InPhysicalEquipmentRepository](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apiinout/repository/InPhysicalEquipmentRepository.java).

For each piece of equipment, its type

```shell
For each physical equipment : if(item.model = ref_matching_item.item_source) is found
then triger the calculation with the data of selected ref_item_impact.name = ref_matching_item.item_target
else
ref_item_impact.name = ref_item_type.ref_default_item

```

and location are matched against referential data to ensure accuracy. Then, the it's impacts are accessed based on specific criteria, lifecycle steps, and hypotheses.

The external [EvaluateNumEcoEvalService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/engine/numecoeval/EvaluateNumEcoEvalService.java) is uses it's method calculatePhysicalEquipment to calculate impacts.
The results for physical equipment indicators are aggregated in memory, and both the input data and generated indicators are written to CSV files.

#### Virtual Equipment:

Virtual equipment entities corresponding to each physicalEquipment are retrieved from the database in batches via the [InVirtualEquipmentRepository](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apiinout/repository/InVirtualEquipmentRepository.java).
Processes virtual equipment associated with physical equipment or cloud services based on infrastructure type.

The calculateVirtualEquipment mehtod of [EvaluateNumEcoEvalService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/engine/numecoeval/EvaluateNumEcoEvalService.java) from numEcoEval library is used for the non cloud virtual equipment.
The results for virtual equipment indicators are aggregated in memory, and both the input data and generated indicators are written to CSV files.

#### Application:

Retrieve application data from the input file, then map these applications to their respective virtual equipment, and calculate the impacts. Finally aggregate application impacts based on the virtual equipment data.
The calculateApplication method of [EvaluateNumEcoEvalService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/engine/numecoeval/EvaluateNumEcoEvalService.java) from numEcoEval library is used for the traditional virtual equipment.

### Models to save indicators

Below you will find the entities used to save the generated indicators in the database.

These entities are by saved by the [SaveService class](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/blob/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apievaluating/business/asyncevaluatingservice/SaveService.java) using the 'out' repositories in the [package](https://github.com/G4ITTeam/g4it/tree/main/services/backend/src/main/java/com/soprasteria/g4it/backend/apiinout/repository).

### Export Process

The csv files stored in the local directory are compressed into a ZIP file and uploads it to file storage.
Local directory is cleaned up after successful uploads.

### Task life cycle:

The task progress percentage is updated dynamically during processing and sets to COMPLETED upon successful execution with progress set to 100%.
Any errors encountered during execution are logged, and the task status is marked as FAILED.

Here is the status of the task:

This task has the type EVALUATING.
