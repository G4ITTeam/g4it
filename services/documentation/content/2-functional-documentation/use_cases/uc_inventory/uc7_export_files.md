This use case allows a sustainable IT leader to generate and download the previously uploaded files, used to create
datacenters, physical and virtual equipment or applications, as well as their evaluated impacts, in .csv format.

This is only for users with "write" role access.  
Export files generated during export are kept for 7 days on Azure storage space and deleted afterward.  
When this allowed time expires, an error message appears when user tries to download.
